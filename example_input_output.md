# Example Input and Output

Here's are examples of input prompts and their corresponding outputs that were generated by the fine-tuned `unsloth/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct` model. These examples demonstrate the model's capabilities and showcase its behavior when interacting with different types of input prompts.

## **Example 1: Story Generation**
### Input:
```plaintext
Once upon a time
```

### Output:
```plaintext
Once upon a time, in a small village nestled among rolling hills, there lived a kind and curious child named Aria. She spent her days exploring the nearby forests, befriending animals, and dreaming of adventures far beyond her little world. One day, she discovered a glowing key buried beneath the roots of an ancient oak tree, setting her on a journey that would change her life forever.
```

## **Example 2: Conversational Response**
### Input:
```plaintext
What are the benefits of regular exercise?
```

### Output:
```plaintext
Regular exercise has numerous benefits for both physical and mental health. Physically, it helps maintain a healthy weight, strengthens muscles and bones, improves cardiovascular health, and boosts immunity. Mentally, exercise can reduce stress, alleviate symptoms of anxiety and depression, enhance mood, and improve sleep quality. Additionally, it fosters a sense of accomplishment and can increase overall energy levels throughout the day.
```

## **Example 3: Instruction Following**
### Input:
```plaintext
Explain how photosynthesis works in simple terms.
```

### Output:
```plaintext
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants make their own food using sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide. The leaves of plants contain a green pigment called chlorophyll, which captures sunlight. Using the energy from sunlight, plants convert carbon dioxide from the air and water from the soil into glucose (a type of sugar) and oxygen. The glucose provides energy for the plant, and the oxygen is released into the air for us to breathe.
```

## **Example 4: Code Completion**
### Input:
```plaintext
Write a Python function to calculate the factorial of a number.
```

### Output:
```python
def factorial(n):
    """
    Calculate the factorial of a number using recursion.

    Args:
        n (int): The number to calculate the factorial for.

    Returns:
        int: The factorial of the given number.
    """
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)

# Example usage:
print(factorial(5))  # Output: 120
```

## **Example 5: Problem Solving**
### Input:
```plaintext
If a train travels at 60 miles per hour for 3 hours, how far does it travel?
```

### Output:
```plaintext
To calculate the distance, use the formula: Distance = Speed × Time.

Here:
- Speed = 60 miles per hour
- Time = 3 hours

Distance = 60 × 3 = 180 miles

The train travels 180 miles.
```

## **Example 6: Creative Writing**
### Input:
```plaintext
Write a haiku about the ocean.
```

### Output:
```plaintext
Waves crash on the shore,  
Whispers of the deep abyss,  
Endless blue above.  
```

## **Example 7: Factual Query**
### Input:
```plaintext
Who was the first president of the United States?
```

### Output:
```plaintext
The first president of the United States was George Washington. He served as president from 1789 to 1797 and played a pivotal role in the founding of the nation.
```

## **Example 8: Advice**
### Input:
```plaintext
How can I save more money each month?
```

### Output:
```plaintext
Here are a few tips to save more money each month:
1. Create a budget: Track your income and expenses to identify areas where you can cut back.
2. Reduce unnecessary spending: Limit dining out, cancel unused subscriptions, and shop for deals.
3. Save first: Set aside a portion of your income for savings before spending on other items.
4. Cook at home: Preparing meals at home can save a significant amount compared to eating out.
5. Avoid impulse purchases: Wait 24 hours before making non-essential purchases to see if they’re truly necessary.

Small changes can add up over time and significantly boost your savings!
```

## **Example 9: Text Summarization**
### Input:
```plaintext
Summarize the following text:  
"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science that focuses on creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding. AI is used in various applications, including autonomous vehicles, healthcare diagnostics, virtual assistants, and more."
```

### Output:
```plaintext
AI is a branch of computer science that develops systems to perform tasks requiring human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, and language understanding. It has applications in autonomous vehicles, healthcare, virtual assistants, and more.
```

## **Example 10: Jokes**
### Input:
```plaintext
Tell me a joke about programming.
```

### Output:
```plaintext
Why do programmers prefer dark mode?

Because light attracts bugs!
```
